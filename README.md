# Build Tools Introduction

## Learning Goals

- Explain what a build tool does.

## Introduction

A Java project consists of the source code, test code, configurations,
libraries, dependencies, task runners in a structured folder. A build tool helps
us to manage an entire project and create a workflow for generating easily
runnable applications.

## Features

Modern build tools like Maven can perform a wide variety of tasks that
developers need to do daily. Here are some of the things you might use Maven
for:

1. Adding Dependencies: We can add dependencies to our project easily by using
   declarative definitions.
2. Compilation: We can define compilation criteria and commands to streamline
   the compilation process.
3. Packaging Compiled Code: Build processes can be defined to generate
   production-ready application archives like JAR.
4. Test Runners: We can create test workflows to automatically run tests based
   on certain criteria to avoid bugs after altering the code.
5. Easy Configuration: Modern tools generally have a lot of conventions to make
   it easier to start a project while also being highly configurable.
6. Cross Platform: Allows projects to be easily managed across different
   environments.

## Conclusion

A build tool makes it a lot easier to manage large projects. Weâ€™ll primarily
focus on Maven in this module but there are other great tools like Gradle you
can look into.
